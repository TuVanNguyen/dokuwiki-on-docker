  - Is my current job my ideal job?
  - What actions must be taken to further my career?
  - What doors are closed? What aspects of my professional life can no longer be altered?
  - What is my level of performance in my current job? Am I on the right track or am I slacking and why?
  - What do I need to change and improve?
  - Is something in my past affecting my current work status?
  - What results can I expect if I follow the guidance from this reading? If this is a negative card, maybe there's something misinterpreted in the reading and you'll have to revisit these questions later.
