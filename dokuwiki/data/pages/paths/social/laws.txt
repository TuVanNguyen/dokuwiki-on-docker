====== The Laws of Social Engineering ======

===== 1. There is no security through obscurity =====
==== Background ====
  * originates in the security field as far back as 1851 Alfred Charles Hobbs demonstrates how state-of-the-art locks can be picked and argues that keeping the design of locks secret will not protect them from rogues ((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity))
  * In the cybersecurity world, it is well known that open-source software can be as or even more secure as proprietary counterparts. That's because sharing code allows a large community of users to catch bugs and security holes leaving less time for attackers to exploit them.

==== Application ====
  - Do not use tactics that entirely depend on secrecy to work
    * In this information age, people are more than likely to realize what you're attempting to do sooner or later
    * It will make you come off as more unscrupulous, immoral, or untrustworthy
    * If you're unfortunate enough to have enemies, it will give them a larger attack surface

===== 2. Passive Investment Outperforms Active Investment =====
==== Background ====
  * In stock market trading, it is well known that passive investment funds based on an index like S&P 500 outperforms a large majority of actively managed funds
  * Partly because actively managed funds rack up greater expenses and taxes
  * Also the stock market is volatile in the short term, but has consistent performance in the long term

==== Application ====
  - Focus more on building a reputation
    * slower to build up, but can compound exponentially
    * more guaranteed returns
  - Do not invest as much effort into persuasion tactics
    * unpredictable results with likelier losses 
    * can come off as "try-hard" or disingenuous
